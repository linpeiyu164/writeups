# The Lobby

We are given a repository that looks like this:
<https://github.com/linpeiyu164/The-Lobby>

In the actions/workflow, we see that upon commenting `/join` on the Role Call issue, two challenge repositories with two flags will be setup for us:

A section of the workflow:

    - name: Generating & encrypting flag 1
    env:
        LOGIN: ${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}
    uses: maclarel/actions-set-secret@v/1.9.9
    with:
        name: 'FLAG'
        value: ${{ secrets.FLAG1 }}
        repository: "OctoHigh/challenge-1-${{ env.LOGIN }}"
        token: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_TOKEN }}

    - name: Generating & encrypting flag 2
    env:
        LOGIN: ${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}
    uses: maclarel/actions-set-secret@v/1.9.9
    with:
        name: 'FLAG'
        value: ${{ secrets.FLAG2 }}
        repository: "OctoHigh/challenge-2-${{ env.LOGIN }}"
        token: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_TOKEN }}

However, the comment also hints that there is another flag in this repository.
By inspecting the readme, we can see that there are special characters hidden in the text. Pick out those special characters and find the flag.
